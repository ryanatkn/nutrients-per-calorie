*made with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and [d3](http://d3js.org/)*


:elephant: Mission
==================

This app attempts to help us make better food choices by putting the nutrition data from the [USDA National Nutrient Database](http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/) in an easily digestible form. By comparing foods in terms of nutrients per calorie, we're able to get an idea of what's healthy and what's empty.


:octopus: Play with the code
============================

To tinker with the uncompiled code, you'll need [Node](http://nodejs.org), [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).
  
    npm install
    npm start


:monkey: Get the raw data
=========================

The raw nutritional data can be downloaded [here at the USDA's website](http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=22771). I used the Access version and exported it to CSV after making a new table with the needed fields.
