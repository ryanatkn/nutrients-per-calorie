  <h3>Mission</h3>
  <p>
    This app attempts to help us make better food choices by putting the nutrition data from the <a href="http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/">USDA National Nutrient Database</a> in an easily digestible form. By comparing foods in terms of nutrients per calorie, we're able to get an idea of what's healthy and what's empty.
